# [TrailBot Watcher](https://trailbot.io) <sup><sub><sup><sub>DEVELOPER PREVIEW</sub></sup></sub></sup>

TrailBot tracks changes in your servers' files and logs and triggers smart policies.

[Smart Policies](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies) are simple scripts that receive notifications every time a watched file changes. They trigger actions such as emailing someone, rolling files back or even shutting the system down.

TrailBot has three components:
+ [__Watcher__](https://github.com/trailbot/watcher): (this repository) a server daemon that monitors your files and logs, registers file events and enforces [smart policies](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies).
+ [__Client__](https://github.com/trailbot/client): desktop app for managing watchers, defining policies and reading file events.
+ [__Vault__](https://github.com/trailbot/vault): a backend that works as a relay for the watcher's settings and the server events.
